Hi Ranchodas,

This is to acknowledge that we have received your request to be withdrawn from the Android Tech Fellow Training course. Being withdrawn from the class will change your role to becoming an **Observer**. 

As an Observer, you will have the following benefits:
1. Lifetime access to the course material that you can study at your own pace
2. No more due dates or any expectations on the coursework and attendance

Further, we are inviting you to sign-up and join our mailing list to receive updates on upcoming courses and events at CodePath. 

Thank you, 

CodePath.org Team
