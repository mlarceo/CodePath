Hi Pia, 

We have a strict policy on attendance and consecutive absences are not tolerated. Based on our [course policies](https://codepath.org/classes), any student who will incur absences will be automatically withdrawn from the course. 

We see your enthusiasm and great interest in completing the Cybersecurity course. But, we also understand that you have a full schedule and commitments at the moment. Given that, we recommend that you take the course when you have less load and more available to attend the sessions. The Cybersecurity course will be available next semester and we are willing to reconsider you in that class. 

Please let us know if you have any questions and how you plan to move forward given the options. Our team would be glad to assist you. 

Regards,

CodePath.org Team
