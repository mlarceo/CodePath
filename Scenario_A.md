Hi Raju, 

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your attendance. 

Upon checking the records in the session last Saturday, August 5th, it showed us that you have stayed in the session for **less than the prescribed duration** which resulted in being marked as **Absent**. 

We would like to remind you that aside from technical skills, CodePathâ€™s educational model puts a high value on punctuality and your ability to complete the sessions. To avoid such circumstances to happen again, you may refer to the [course policies and expectations](https://codepath.org/classes). 

Regards,
CodePath.org Team
